		- MM | add WS to have reactive status
		- AVM | prevent players to watch their own games (host game or guest game)
		- AVM | check reactivity front + do we need to take out .value when using store
		- AVM | streaming : customize bug, last frame ? rainbow 

		wait matteo
		- DialogEdit : bug, does not update username, avatar ok (issue with string validation ?) - probably why it does not close (first debug this), added debug logs, cannot find the issue
		- Dialog2FA : same problem

		- Game : ball bug

	KEEP IN MIND
		- jwt expired
		- 2fa login redirect

	NICE_TO_HAVE, IF THERE IS TIME
		- beautify, consistent UI
		- smooth paddle animation
	
	PROBABLY WON'T HAVE TIME
